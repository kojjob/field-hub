# FieldHub Service Platform

FieldHub is a white-label, industry-agnostic Field Service Management (FSM) platform engineered for scale and flexibility. It empowers contractors and service businesses to manage their entire operation—from job scheduling and dispatch to customer management and invoicing—within a single, intuitive interface.

## 🎯 Project Vision

FieldHub creates a standardized yet customizable core for the service industry. Whether for HVAC, Plumbing, Landscaping, or Home Health, FieldHub adapts to the jargon and workflow of the specific vertical without code changes.

### Core Philosophy
*   **Industry Agnostic:** Built to be renamed and reconfigured. "Technicians" can become "Providers", "Jobs" can become "Visits".
*   **Real-Time First:** Built on Phoenix LiveView for instant updates across Dispatch and Mobile.
*   **Mobile Optimized:** A PWA experience for field workers that rivals native apps.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🏢 Organization & Multi-Tenancy
* **Secure Isolation:** Complete data separation between tenant organizations.
* **Custom Settings:** Each organization configures its own terminology, branding, and workflows.
* **Custom Fields:** Dynamic schema extension for Jobs, Customers, and Technicians properly integrated into forms.

### 🧩 Dispatch & Operations
* **Inter-System Connectivity:** Seamless syncing between dispatch, mobile, and customer views.
* **Intelligent Sidebar:** Persistent, collapsible navigation with teal branding and tooltips for minimized view.

### 🌐 Customer Portal

* **History Tracking:** Clients can view past and upcoming jobs.
* **Invoicing & Payments:** Seamless viewing of invoices with integrated payment options.
* **Brand Consistency:** Uses the organization's custom colors and terminology.

### 📱 Technician Mobile PWA

* **Offline-Ready:** (In progress) Architecture supports low-connectivity environments via local data sync and background SMS fallback.
* **Job Lifecycle:** Simple one-tap status updates.
* **Evidence Capture:** Photos, signatures, and notes attached directly to the job event log.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

* **Elixir & Phoenix (1.7+):** The backbone of our fault-tolerant, concurrent backend.
* **Phoenix LiveView:** For rich, real-time client-side interactions.
* **PostgreSQL:** Relational data integrity.
* **TailwindCSS:** Utility-first styling for a premium, custom UI.
* **Alpine.js / Hooks:** For client-side interactions (Maps, Charts).
